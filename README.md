# Hi, I'm Ashwath 👋

Backend Engineer building reliable systems, scalable APIs, and tools that solve real-world problems.

Currently working as an **Associate Software Engineer** at **Fyle (now part of Sage)**, where I work on backend systems powering financial automation and data processing workflows.

I enjoy understanding and learning *how systems behave in production* — performance, reliability, and clean architecture matter more to me than flashy tech stacks.
